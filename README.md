# Vue.js + Webpack example

> Note! This example has been updated to use Vue 0.12+ and makes use of the async components feature.

This example demonstrates using Webpack as the build tool for Vue.js apps, including:

- Organize your app into views & components.
- Directly `require()` CSS (Stylus) files and HTML templates via configured loaders.
- Split your build into multiple chunks that are lazy-loaded.

## Setup

``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
open http://localhost:8080/
```
